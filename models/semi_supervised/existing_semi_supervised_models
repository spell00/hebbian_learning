From Kingma et al. Semi-supervised Learning with Deep Generative Models (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5298.pdf)

"We compare to a broad range of existing solutions in semi-
supervised learning,  in particular to classification using nearest neighbours (NN), support vector
machines on the labelled set (SVM), the transductive SVM (TSVM), and contractive auto-encoders
(CAE). Some of the best results currently are obtained by the manifold tangent classifier (MTC)
(Rifai et al., 2011) and the AtlasRBF method (Pitelis et al., 2014).  Unlike the other models in this
comparison, our models are fully probabilistic but have a cost in the same order as these alternatives"
